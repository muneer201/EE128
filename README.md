EE 128 – Microcontroller Systems Laboratory (FRDM-K64F)

This repository contains my laboratory work for EE 128 (Microcontroller Systems) at the University of California, Riverside. The labs focus on hardware–software integration using the FRDM-K64F (MK64FN1M0VLL12) microcontroller, covering digital I/O, interrupts, timers, ADC, motor control, and serial communication protocols.

All labs include source code, schematics, and documentation demonstrating low-level embedded systems programming and hardware interfacing.

Labs Overview
Lab 1 – Schematic Design & Cadence Capture

Installed and configured Cadence Capture CIS

Designed basic analog circuits (555 timer)

Created microcontroller schematics with LEDs and DIP switches

Practiced pin mapping and schematic documentation


Lab 2 – Digital I/O, Counters, and Rotators

Implemented an 8-bit bidirectional counter

Implemented a one-hot LED rotator

Used DIP switches for direction control

Interfaced LED bars with GPIO ports


Lab 3 – Interrupts & ADC

Built an interrupt-driven system

Displayed ADC voltage and counter values on dual 7-segment displays

Used external interrupts and ADC0

Measured interrupt latency using an oscilloscope


Lab 4 – Timers & PWM Measurement

Generated PWM using an Arduino

Measured PWM duty cycle using FTM input capture

Displayed duty cycle on 7-segment displays

Learned timer prescaling and signal timing


Lab 5 – Stepper Motor Control

Controlled a bipolar stepper motor using L298N H-bridge

Implemented CW/CCW rotation with variable speed

Used DIP switches for direction and speed control

Applied correct stepping sequences and delay timing


Lab 6 – Serial Communication (UART, I2C, SPI)

Read accelerometer and magnetometer data via I2C

Sent sensor data to a PC using UART

Established SPI communication between K64F and Arduino

Measured communication latency using GPIO timing pulses and an oscilloscope
